        <div class="content">
          HANGZHOU FANTAI PLASTIC CO. LTD is located in Hangzhou, the beautiful
          tourist city of Zhejiang Province, professionally exports PVC fences
          to North America, Australia, Europe, Middle East, and South Africa,
          and more and more countries and regions interests in PVC/Vinyl fence.
          Fentech fences are manufactured with virgin PVC/Vinyl material and UV
          Protected. The material is lightweight and easy to install, with a DIY
          option for the handyman. PVC/Vinyl Fence has been more and more
          popular in recent years due to its durability and the lack of need for
          maintenance. More than that, lots of plus points you will gain by
          selecting PVC Fence: NO PAINT, only need general cleaning. Saves your
          time and money. NO FADING does not lose its color at all. NO ROT, no
          fear of Vinyl fences rusting or rotting or getting decomposed like
          other materials. NO WORRIES! Non-toxic as compared to some of the
          other fencing materials. The available colors are white, grey, and
          tan. We supply picket fence, pool fence, horse fence, privacy fence,
          semi-privacy fence and railings and matching gates for villa, garden,
          park, pool, ranch, etc. Post---Posts are the most important member of
          a fence section. It holds the rails & the section in place. Posts take
          the load of the fence and are either mounted on a flat surface with a
          flange or are driven 2 to 3 feet under the ground. The Posts are
          routed in such a way that they accommodate the rails. Line Post---This
          constitutes the largest part of most fence jobs. They are usually at
          every 8 feet or 6 feet section depending on the size of the sections
          used for fencing. Line posts are routed on both sides (opposite to
          each other) so as to accommodate rails/ sections from each side.
          Corner Post---These posts are used on corners & have their adjacent
          faces routed. So they give the desired corner angle in the fence. End
          Post---These are routed only on one side and are used in ends usually
          by wall or pillar. A routed hole on one side accommodates the section
          while the other end is not routed. End Gate Post---These are usually
          designed stronger than regular posts in most cases to hold the Gate.
          These posts are routed only on one side to receive the fence section.
          Blank Post / Blank Gate Post ---These Posts are never routed at all.
          Blank Posts are mostly used where you have the wall on one side & a
          gate on the other side of the post. At Fentech Fences, once the client
          has ordered with us, we will forward a technical drawing of your
          fences for your approval and sign off before manufacturing begins. The
          foreign trade manager with his team have worked on fences many years
          and have rich experience of contacting with clients, solving nearly
          all problems come from clients professionally and promptly, he is good
          at preparing samples for foreign customers, how to pack, how-to guide
          workers to load goods into containers, and also skilled in space
          booking, customs declaration and relative documents produced. We are
          looking for distributors in different areas and countries. I do
          believe that Join in Us, Win in Future.
